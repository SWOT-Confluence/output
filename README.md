# output

**NOTE: Output currently extracts and writes Sacramento data (stored on disk) from directories organized by time step.**

Output serves as the last Confluence module where it creates a new version and appends the results of a Confluence run to the SoS. It writes data from various EFS mounts that serve different stages to a temporary directory and then uploads the resulting files to the SoS S3 bucket.
